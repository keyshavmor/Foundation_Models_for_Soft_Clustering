--- 4. GMM Entropy Distribution per 'cell2' Label ---
Redirecting plt.show(): Saving figure 8 to autosaved_plots/autosaved_plot_8.png

Interpretation Guide (?):
- Higher entropy for a cell indicates it has similar probabilities of belonging to multiple GMM clusters (more uncertainty/ambiguity).
- Lower entropy indicates the cell is strongly assigned to one GMM cluster.
- Examining entropy distribution within known 'cell2' groups can reveal:
  - Groups with consistently low entropy: Likely well-separated and confidently clustered by GMM.
  - Groups with consistently high entropy: May represent intermediate states, poorly separated populations, or areas where GMM struggles.
  - Groups with wide entropy variance: Might contain subpopulations with different clustering certainties.
