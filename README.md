# Foundation_models_NB
## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

This project leverages recent **single-cell foundation models** â€” such as **SCimilarity**, **CancerFoundation**, **scGPT**, and **scBERT** â€” to extract informative embeddings from **Neuroblastoma** data. These embeddings enable improved analysis of **cellular heterogeneity** and the identification of **clinically relevant subpopulations**.

## ðŸŒ± Branch Structure

To keep development organized, each foundation model has its **own dedicated branch**:

- [`scGPT`](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/tree/scGPT) â€” Work related to the scGPT model  
- [`CancerFoundation`](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/tree/CancerFoundation) â€” Code and experiments using the CancerFoundation model  
- [`SCimilarity`](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/tree/SCimilarity) â€” Integrations and analysis using SCimilarity  

You are encouraged to work within the branch corresponding to your model of interest.
